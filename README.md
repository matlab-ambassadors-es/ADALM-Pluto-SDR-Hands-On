# ADALM-Pluto SDR Hands-On
This repo contains all the materials needed to perform the ADALM-Pluto SDR Hands-On event developed by Spanish MATLAB Ambassadors. The proposed 2.5h event consists of a  theoretical-practical session designed for undergraduate engineering students interested in how to apply their signal processing skills to RF by using a software-defined radio.
## Software Requirements
The following MATLAB Toolboxes are required to be installed prior to the event:
1. Communications Toolbox™ 
2. [Communications System Toolbox™ Support Package for Analog Devices® ADALM- Pluto Radio](https://es.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/61624-communications-toolbox-support-package-for-analog-devices-adalm-pluto-radio)
3. Simulink®
4. DSP System Toolbox™
5. WLAN Toolbox™

## Hardware Requirements
The recommended hardware to complete each of the proposed SDR exercises, consists of:

- **Laptop or PC with Internet Connection**
- [**ADALM-PLUTO Active Learning Module**](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html#eb-overview): Omnidirectional antennas are required
- **FM Radio:** Having a commercial Digital or even Analog FM Radio/Receiver, can be useful for validating the FM transmission and reception exercises.
